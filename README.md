Filtering and Waveform Analysis for Cardiac Organoids Electrophysiological Signal based on Three-dimensional mapping and regulation of action potential propagation in nanoelectronics-innervated tissues previously published on Nature Nanotechnology. Butterworth filter and k-means clustering algorithm are applied.
Cardiac organoids are novel in-vitro platform for disease modelling, pre-clinical test and developmental biology research. Electrophysiology signal detection and analysis are vital for function characterization of cardiac cells. Advanced flexible electronics are able to achieve extracellular electrical potential detection in subcellular dimensions and a sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Here, we filter the electrophysiology signal from a published paper by Butter low pass filter and reproduce some figures from the original paper. Then we perform waveform analysis clustering by an unsupervised algorism to produce principal waveforms. Dimensional reduction and waveform detection are also carried out.
